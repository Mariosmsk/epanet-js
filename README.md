Water distribution network modelling, either in the browser or Node. Uses the Open Water Analytics EPANET v2.2 toolkit compiled to Javascript.

> **Note**: All version before 1.0.0 should be considered beta with potential breaking changes between releases, use in production with caution.

## Install
To install the stable version with npm:

```
$ npm install epanet-js
```

or with yarn:

```
$ yarn add epanet-js
```

For those without a module bundler, the epanet-js package will soon also be available on unpkg as a precompiled UMD builds. This will allow you to drop a UMD build in a `<script>` tag on your page and access it on the window.epanetJs global variable.


## Usage
### Load and run an existing inp File

```js
import {Project, Workspace} from 'epanet-js'
import fs from 'fs'

// Read an existing inp file from the disk
const net1 = fs.readFileSync('net1.inp')

// Initialise a new Workspace and Project object
const ws = new Workspace();
const model = new Project(ws);

// Write a copy of the inp file to the workspace
ws.writeFile('net1.inp', net1);

// Runs toolkit methods: EN_open, EN_solveH & EN_close
model.open('net1.inp', 'report.rpt', 'out.bin');
model.solveH()
model.close()
```

## About

Engineers use hydraulic modelling software to simulate water networks. A model will represent a network consisting of pipes, pumps, valves and storage tanks. The modelling software tracks the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each node, the height of water in each tank throughout the network during a multi-period simulation. 

EPANET is an industry-standard program, initially developed by the USEPA, to simulate water distribution networks, its source code was released in the public domain. An open-source fork by the OWA (Open Water Analytics) community has been released extending its original capabilities. Read more about EPANET on Wikipedia and the OWA community on their website.

The EPANET Toolkit is an API written in C that allows developers to embed the EPANET's engine in their own applications. Ports of the toolkit exist in Python and Matlab; however, there are limited options to use the EPANET engine in JavaScript.

Epanet-js is a full port of version 2.2 OWA-EPANET Toolkit in Typescript, providing access to all 120 functions within the toolkit.

The JavaScript library is for engineers, developers and academics to quickly run and share hydraulic analyses or create custom front end or server-side applications.



### Roadmap

Reaching version 1.0.0 is the current focus, the first non-beta version will have API stability and have mirrored functions of each method in the EPANET Toolkit.

Also planned are helper classes and an object-oriented wrapper to allow simpler development of applications using the EPANET engine.

See the remaining task on the [Version 1.0.0 Project](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/projects/1).


## Featured Apps

The following apps were created using the epanet-js engine, please let us know any apps you've made.

### Model View

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcreate/model-view/master/ModelViewPreview.gif" alt="Model View" height="150" align="center"/>

Display models created in EPANET directly in the browser. No data leaves your computer; all data rendered and processed locally using the epanet-js library.

**Website**: [Model View](https://view.modelcreate.com/)

**Source Code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/modelcreate/model-view)


### Model Calibrate

Extract subsections of your InfoWorks WS Pro models and run them in your browser. As you make calibration changes such as modifying roughness or restriction valves the application runs an epanet model and compares the simulated results to those observered in the field.

**Website**: [Model Calibrate](https://calibrate.modelcreate.com/)


## Build

epanet-js is split into two packages, the epanet-engine package which wraps the original C code in C++ and compiles it to JavaScript using Emscripten. And epanet-js is a TypeScript library which wraps over the generated module from Emscripten and manages memory allocation, error handling and returning of varaible.

**Building epanet-engine**

The first command `yarn run build:dockerimage` creates a docker container of Emscripten and the compiled OWA-EPANET source code, you can then run `yarn run build` to compile the C++ wrapper into Javascript.

```sh
cd packages/epanet-engine
yarn run build:dockerimage
yarn run build
```

**Building epanet-js**

You must first build epanet-engine before you can lint, test or build epanet-js.

```sh
cd packages/epanet-js
yarn run lint
yarn run test
yarn run build
```

## API

If you are not familiar with the OWA-EPANET Toolkit API or EPANET it is worthwhile reading their [API documentation](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/) and [wiki](https://github.com/openwateranalytics/epanet/wiki).

epanet-js contains two classes, Workspace & Project. A Workspace represents a virtual file system where you can store and read files that are consumed by the tool kit, such as [INP Files](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/wiki/Input-File-Format) or generated by it, such as [RPT](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/wiki/Report-File) or [OUT files](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/wiki/Output-File-Format). 

A Project is a single instance of the EN_Project wrapper object and a singleton with all toolkit methods attached.

All method names have been converted to camelCase due to javascript convention.

> **Note**: The full API has been converted; however, it is not all listed below. [Issue #13](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/issues/13)


### Library Classes

Create a `Workspace` object by instancing the <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Workspace-Clas"><code>Workspace</code></a> class.

```javascript
import { Workspace } from `epanet-js`

const ws = new Workspace()
```

Create a `Project` object by instancing the <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Project-Clas"><code>Project</code></a> class with a <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Workspace-Clas"><code>Workspace</code></a>  object.

```javascript
import { Project, Workspace } from `epanet-js`

const ws = new Workspace()
const model = new Project(ws)
```

For a full list of all functions on the two classes please check the wiki:

* [Project Class](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Project-Class)
